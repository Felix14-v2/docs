# Fabric Installation

:::tip
You don't have to install Fabric Loader manually. There are versions with pre-installed recommended Fabric builds in the Legacy Launcher
:::

1. Make sure you have [Java installed](../faq/java)
2. Download Fabric Installer from [the website](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/)
3. Launch downloaded installer with double-clicking it
4. Install Fabric Loader. It will be installed as separate version
    1. Make sure "Client" tab is selected
    2. Select game and Fabric Loader versions
    3. Make sure "Location" path points to same game folder as in the launcher settings
    4. Press "Install"
5. Start (or restart) the launcher
6. Select newly installed Fabric version
    :::tip[How I can find it?]
    Manually installed Fabric version will be named like `fabric-loader-XXX-YYY`, where `XXX` is the Fabric version and `YYY` is the Minecraft version, e.g. `fabric-loader-0.15.7-1.20.4`
    :::
    :::warning
    Most Fabric mods require [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) mod (often referred as `fabric`). Don't forget to install it!

7. Launch the game
