# Forge Installation

:::tip
You don't have to install Forge manually. There are versions with pre-installed recommended Forge builds in the Legacy Launcher
:::

1. Make sure you have [Java installed](../faq/java)
2. Download a Forge Installer for selected version from [the website](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/)
    1. (optional) Download non-modified ("vanilla") Minecraft version using Legacy Launcher
3. Launch the installer by double-clicking it
4. Install Forge. It will be installed as separate version
    1. Select "Install client"
    2. In the field below, select the path to the game folder. Make sure it is the same as in the launcher settings
    3. Press "OK"/"Install" button and wait until installation ends
5. Start (or restart) the launcher
6. Select newly installed Forge version
    :::tip[How I can find it?]
    Manually installed Forge version will be named like `XXX-forge-YYY`, where `XXX` is the Minecraft version and `YYY` is the Forge version, e.g. `1.20.2-forge-48.1.0`
    :::
7. Launch the game
