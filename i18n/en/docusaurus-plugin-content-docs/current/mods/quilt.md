# Quilt Installation
:::tip
You don't have to install Quilt manually. There are versions with pre-installed recommended Quilt builds in the Legacy Launcher
:::

1. Make sure you have [Java installed](../faq/java)
2. Download Quilt Installer from [the website](https://quiltmc.org/en/install/client/)
3. Launch downloaded installer with double-clicking it
4. Install Quilt. It will be installed as separate version
    1. Make sure "Client" tab is selected
    2. Select game and Quilt versions
    3. Make sure "Location" path points to same game folder as in the launcher settings
    4. Press "Install"
5. Start (or restart) the launcher
6. Select newly installed Fabric version
    :::tip[How I can find it?]
    Manually installed Quilt version will be named like `quilt-loader-XXX-YYY`, where `XXX` is the Quilt version and `YYY` is the Minecraft version, e.g. `quilt-loader-0.15.7-1.20.4`
    :::
    :::warning
    Most Fabric/Quilt mods require [QSL](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl) mod (`fabric-api` analog). Don't forget to install it!

7. Launch the game
