Installation modpack in general does not differ from [mods installation](./installation). It all depends on the source of the modpack.

## Curseforge
1. Download and install [CurseForge app](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app)
    :::tip
    We recommend you to use "Standalone" app, not "Overwolf" one
    :::
2. Select "Minecraft" game

3. Open "Browse" tab
    !["Browse" tab](./img/modpack-cf-browse.png)
    :::tip
    CurseForge app allows one to create own modpacks. One can do it using "Create Custom Profile" option. This manual does not cover this use case
