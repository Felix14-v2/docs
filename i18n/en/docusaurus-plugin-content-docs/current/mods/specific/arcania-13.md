# Arcania 1.3
:::note[What's the problem?]
This modpack uses outdated mods requiring older Fabric Loader version
:::

## Updating the mods {#update-mods}
:::tip[This is the recommended solution]
:::
You should update the "Bosses Of Mass Destruction" ("BOMD") mod.
1. Download latest mod version for Minecraft 1.20.1 from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/bosses-of-mass-destruction/versions?g=1.20.1)
2. Remove old mod file (`BOMD-1.7.x-1.20.1.jar`) from mods folder
3. Place new mod version to mods folder
4. Launch the game

## Downgrading Fabric Loader {#downgrade-fabric}
You should install Fabric Loader 0.14.25 using [this manual](../fabric)
