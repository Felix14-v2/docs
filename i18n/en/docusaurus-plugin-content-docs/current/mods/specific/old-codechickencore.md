# CodeChickenCore for Minecraft 1.7.10
:::note[What's the problem?]
CodeChickenCore tries to download non-existing library file
:::

## Replace CodeChickenCore with unofficial version {#ccc-unofficial}
:::tip[Recommended method]
:::
GregTech New Horizons modpack developers published a patched CodeChickenCore and CodeChickenLib with some fixes. Replace your mods with [CodeChickenCore Unofficial](https://modrinth.com/mod/codechickencore-unofficial) and [CodeChickenLib Unofficial](https://modrinth.com/mod/codechickenlib-unofficial).

## Find working CodeChickenLib {#ccl-official}
There is a corrupted `CodeChickenLib` mod file in the `mods/1.7.10` folder. You can try to find the original version somewhere in the Web and replace it. Unfortunately, we are not able to help with that.
