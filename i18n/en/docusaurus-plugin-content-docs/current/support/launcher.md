description: What to do if Legacy Launcher does not start
---
# Cannot start the launcher?
:::warning
This article is for those who **cannot start the launcher at all**. If you can get to the launcher main menu, or got an error window with "Need help?" button, please refer to [support guide](./game)
:::

## Got the window with "Need help?" button? {#need-help}
Press "Need help?" button and [contact our support](./game#contact).

## There is no launcher windows, even the error one?
You need to run the Launcher manually, via Terminal (Command Line).

### Windows
1. Make sure you have [Java installed](../faq/java#windows)
2. Download latest jar from [the main website](https://llaun.ch/latest) or from [the mirror](https://lln4.ru/latest)
3. Save the downloaded file to a convenient location, such as your desktop
4. Make sure the file is called `LegacyLauncher_legacy_beta.jar` and nothing else
5. Open Notepad and paste following text:
    ```batch title="LL.bat"
    @echo Checking Java version
    @java -version > LL.log 2>&1
    @echo. >> LL.log 2>&1
    @echo Starting the launcher
    @java -cp LegacyLauncher_legacy_beta.jar Debug >> LL.log 2>&1
    @echo Done
    ```
6. Save this file as `LL.bat` (to do this, select the file type `All files (.*)` in the "Save as..." dialog) **along with the launcher file**. This is important!
7. Start created file with double-clicking. `LL.log` file should appear
        :::note[How do I make sure I've done it right?]
    * If the `LL.log` file contains the line `Unable to access jarfile LegacyLauncher_legacy_beta.jar` - you have not placed `LL.bat` next to the launcher jar or the launcher jar is named differently than `LegacyLauncher_legacy_beta.jar`
    * If the `LL.log` file contains the line `"java" is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file` - you do not have Java installed
        :::tip[Yep, this is a tip inside in a note!]
        Windows Notepad may not display other languages correctly, and a missing Java error may appear as a string of odd characters beginning with the word "java", for example `"java" ­Ґ пў«пҐвбп ў­гваҐ­­Ґ© Ё«Ё ў­Ґи­Ґ© Є®¬ ­¤®©, ЁбЇ®«­пҐ¬®© Їа®Ја ¬¬®© Ё«Ё Ї ЄҐв­л¬ д ©«®¬.`
